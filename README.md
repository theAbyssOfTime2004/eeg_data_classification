eeg_data classification with CNN, KNN, SVM and XGBOOST.
# 1. Introduction
- Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/inancigdem/eeg-data-for-mental-attention-state-detection/data
- data description: EEG data collected over 25 hours from 5 participants, each controlling a train simulator using "Microsoft Train Simulator" for 35-55 minutes on a simple route.
- Mental states label:
  - Focused
  - Unfocused
  - Drowys
- Equipment Setup:
  - The study used a modified Epoc EEG headset with 12 channels, sampling at 128 Hz with 0.51 μV resolution and 0.2–43 Hz bandwidth.
  - The headset was reconfigured to place electrodes over frontal and parietal regions, using electrode positions F3-Fz-F4-C3-Cz-C4-T3-T4-T5-T6-Pz in the 10–20 system.
  - Four leads (T3, T4, T5, T6) served as current and reference channels, while 7 leads (F3, F4, Fz, C3, C4, Cz, Pz) collected data.
  - A custom Matlab script based on eeglogger.m was used for data acquisition
- Procedure:
  - First 10 minutes: Focused control, closely monitoring the screen.
  - Next 10 minutes: Stopped controlling, not paying attention but still alert.
  - Last 10 minutes: Relaxing, eyes closed, allowed to doze off if desired
- Implementation Process:
  - Each participant completed 7 experiments (1 per day), first 2 for familiarization, 5 subsequent ones for data collection.
  - Experiments conducted from 7-9 PM to facilitate easier drowsiness in the final stage.
  - Participants were monitored and filmed to ensure adherence to experimental structure, with no interruptions like moving or talking.
